White/Gray/Black hats
Footprinting 		- researching, information gathering
Dos (just you) 		- Denial of service (apache can handle about 10000 requests)
DDos (Multiple people) 
FUD (anti-virus can not detect)		- fully undetectable
RAT					- remote administration tools
Fishing 			- email with fake link or change DNS on router
SQL Injections		- pass sql queries with http requests
VPN					- virtual private networks, way to anonymise yourself
Proxy				- less reliable way to stay anonymos
Tor					- free open sorce, better than proxy, almost 100% anonymos, can access hidden/dark web
VPS					- Virtual private servers
Key Loggers			- Log key strokes and send to email address, some can extract existing information. Can do other stuff
Terminal			- interface for operation system
Firewall			- configured through ip table
Root kit			- able to hide processes from system itself
Reverse-shells		- program that opens  reverce connection


-- Setting up network on VM
--- Bridged adapter on VM settings
--- if device not managed 
cd /etc/NetworkManage/
--- change managed variable in NetworkAdapter.conf to true
service network-manager restart

-- add repository in /etc/apt/sources.list
--- uncoment line
--- run apt-get dist-upgrad
--- apt-get update && apt-get pgrade
--- install all headers and dkms

-- Tor
--- To access darkweb and anonomize yourself
--- Not installed by default
--- apt-get install tor
--- create a new user
---- adduser user // dont use useradd
--- Install tor browser from off site
--- launch it 
--- hiddenwiki - need to google for url. List of hidden .onion urls
--- Anonymity & Security section is useful for pentesting and ethical hacking
--- Forums and chats are useful but tend to be down
--- don't download and don't run anything, deffinetly not on the host machine
--- don't go against law

-- Proxy Chains
--- to use with combination with tor
--- anonomize footprinting, nmaping, etc 
--- conf file: 
vim /etc/proxychains.conf
--- a lot of free, reasonable fast and stable. but not enought for bruteforcing or anything like this.
--- best proxy protocol is SOCKS5 - make sure to always use them!
--- most used option is dynamic_chain, probably the best
--- must use dynamic_chain with Tor
--- make sure that proxy_dns is enabled, otherwise you are not anonymus
--- Check that tor is running 
service tor status
--- start if required
service tor start
--- verify settings to make sure all wrking and you are anonymous
proxychains firefox www.duckduckgo.com
--- duckduckgo.com doesn't save ips and anonymize you
--- search for "check for dns leaks" to test
--- can run any application through proxichains
proxychains nmap

-- Import custom chains for proxies
--- google for "free socks5 proxies"
--- try to stick with countries who doesn't share info
--- China, Russia, Neatherlands, Germany, sweden
--- not as much matter for legal white hack work
--- add them into /etc/proxychains.conf

--VPN
--- Check settings for VM
--- Devices - Network Settings, might need to be Bridged Adapter, I have NAT seems to be working
---- Promiscuous Mode - Allow All
--- Change DNS servers
cat /etc/resolve.conf
vim /etc/dhcp/dhcpclient.conf
--- google for openDNS ip addresses 
--- add them into prepend line 
--- only 3 can be used 1 main and 2 failsafe
--- restart network manager
system network-manager restart
cat /etc/resolve.conf
--- Check reputation of the DNS servers on forums
--- good to use countries who respect user privacy

-- disable webrtc
about:config - in firefox
--- search
media.peerconnection.enabled
--- set to false
--- google for "open von free"
--- for example vpnbook
--- download openvpn and save login\password
--- unzip it
run in terminal 
openvpn vpnbook-.....ovpn
--- enter login and password
--- let it run for a minute till Initialization Sequence Completed

-- Not that we are trying to hide our real ISP dns server
--- check with dns leaks !!!
--- better to have diffirent country

-- Change MAC
