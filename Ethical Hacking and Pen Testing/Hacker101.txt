Clickjacking
- Framekiller Js - IE has issues with it
- Content Security Policy headers
- X-Frame-Options headers (DENY or SAMEORIGIN) - to restrict origins - gold standard

File inclusion
?page=test
No such file or directory - that means include uses "test" + .php
can it include local and remote files?
?page=http://website.com/test - execute code from test.php
Authorization can be bypassed
?page=admin or ?page=admin_users
Don't let user input into include()
Hardcode page names

Null termination bug
not often works
Null characters - \x00, %00, etc, is used to terminate strings
include($_GET['page'] . '.php');
?page=/etc/passwd%00   - will ignore.php
Test is every time file handling is present especialy with php, but python, ruby and others are also vunerable
Most browsers will strip %00 from request or truncare them there
Burp will allow to embed literl nulls as well as URLencoded(%00) nulls

Password storage
Say no to MD5
Use PBKDF1 and 2 ?
Salting - against rainbow tables
Use BCrypt or SCrypt - solves all the above
Use SHA256 in PBKDF2 using per-user salt values (randomly generated when password changes), with at least 10000 rounds
Can always bump rounds up later

Session Fixation
usually legacy php
2 problems:
- session ID in query string is easily to leak to other user 
- Session ID is the sole mechanism to tie user to browser
New session id for every login, wipe out old session id for every logout

Unchecked redirects
Redirect from server side
